# Image Classification using Stratified-k-fold-cross-validation
This python program demonstrates image classification with stratified k-fold cross validation technique. Library required is keras & tensorflow.
* The DS.zip file contains a sample dataset that I have collected from Kaggle. It consists of three folders (Train, Test, and Validation) and each of these three folders consists of folders according to class labels (e.g., circles, triangles, and squares).
* Change the batch size, epoch, and the structure of the CNN model according to your needs. Here, some naive values are provided without any hyper-parameter tuning.
